# The-simulation-of-acetone-process
 Acetone is produced via several alternative processes, one of which is the dehydrogenation of 2-propanol (IPA).
 The endothermic gas-phase reaction converts IPA to acetone and hydrogen. The process consists of a vaporizer, heated tubular reactor, flash tank, absorber, and two distillation columns.
